Integration of Twitter Authentication

This package is based on [abraham/twitteroauth], but with the following modifications:
- 1 file = 1 class
- autoload class files
- prefixed classes with "Twitter" to avoid conflict when integrated in Frameworks (Laravel...)

This is a working first draft, based on the latest version of twitteroauth (as of Aug 1st 2014).
It also includes a example of workflow to authenticate from a website.

Incoming:
 - simplified workflow to retrieve info
